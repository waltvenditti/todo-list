CURRENT ITEMS TO PONDER
- new project tab, its design 
- the project cards and their layout
- when a task is done, do I delete it or cross it out and move it to the bottom of the list or something
	- thinking move to bottom of list, then have a button to remove completed. 
- past due functionality 



for each task:
- title
- desc
- due date
- priority 

required:
- should be able to view all projects (a project is a distinct todo list)
- should be able to view each todo in each project (title, due date, priority)
- ability to expand individual task items to see/edit details
- ability to delete a task item

Needed:
- when you check an item as done, it should move to bottom of the list or something
- button to add new project at top
- expand/collapse project
- for each project card, add task, delete project, change priority level
- for each task, change due date, change priority, edit description or title
- due date is optional
- can add tasks either through the header, with a menu that lets you pick which project to add it to (maybe even select 'New Project'?), or through the project cards themselves. 
- buttons next to each item, when clicked they become checked and the item is considered done 

Projects arranged linearly, down the page in column fashion. Each project element/card lists:
Title 
Total # items
Expand button
Properties button

Non-numerical schema for ranking project and task priority (high=1, medium=2, low=3, or none=0)

today and this week todo lists populated automatically. Tasks are listed by project, then task priority, then due date (for the this week list).
