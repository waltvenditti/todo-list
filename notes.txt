Non-numerical schema for ranking project and task priority (aleph/beth, gimel, zayin)
For each project you can assign one alpeh (or none). Additionally, one project (or none) can be designated alpeh, and projects have the same ranking system as tasks. 

Alpeh - white, beth - silver, gimel - gold, zayin - rust

today and this week todo lists populated automatically. Tasks are listed by project priority, then task priority, then due date (for the this week list).
