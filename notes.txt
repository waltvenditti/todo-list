CURRENT ITEMS TO PONDER
- new project tab, its design 
- the project cards and their layout
- when a task is done, do I delete it or cross it out and move it to the bottom of the list or something
	- thinking move to bottom of list, then have a button to remove completed. 


for each task:
- title
- desc
- due date
- priority 

required:
- should be able to view all projects (a project is a distinct todo list)
- should be able to view each todo in each project (title, due date, priority)
- ability to expand individual task items to see/edit details
- ability to delete a task item

Needed:
- when you check an item as done, it should move to bottom of the list or something
- button to add new project at top
- expand/collapse project
- for each project card, add task, delete project, change priority level
- for each task, change due date, change priority, edit description or title
- due date is optional

make buttons next to each item, when clicked they become checked and the item is considered done..? 

Projects arranged linearly, down the page in column fashion. Each project element/card lists project name, number of items due today, number of items due this week.

Total # items

Non-numerical schema for ranking project and task priority (primary, secondary, tertiary)/
